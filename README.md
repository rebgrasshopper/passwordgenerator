## Introduction ##

This project can be accessed from any browser on an internet-connected device. It uses a prompt/confirm interface to navigate the various password options, and the password can be copied from the window at the completion of the process.

The program allows for choosing a length between 8 and 128, opting in or out of lower case characters, upper case characters, numbers, and choosing any or none of the available special characters.
